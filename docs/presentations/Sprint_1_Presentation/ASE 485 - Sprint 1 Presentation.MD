**Sprint 1: Backend Discovery & Modeling Complete**

---

## Problem Reminder

Small or disrupted networks lack simple situational awareness tools.

### Enterprise Tools
- Too heavy  
- Too complex  
- Infrastructure dependent  

### NetTower Goal
Provide lightweight, deployable network topology awareness.

- Event models & EventBus system implemented  
- MongoDB integration complete  
- Passive + active discovery integrated  
- Host correlation logic implemented  
- Connectivity (edge) modeling functional  
- Enrichment (OUI + device hints) added  
- Orchestrator loop stabilized  

### Milestones & Deadlines Met

#### Milestone 1 – February 16, 2026
- Planning & Backend Architecture Finalized  

#### Hard Deadline 1 – March 9, 2026
- Backend Core Complete (Sprint 1 Presentation)

## Learning with AI – Packet Structure & Protocol Breakdown

### Objective
Understand packet behavior from frame header to payload.

### Studied
- Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP headers  
- Flags and response codes  
- What indicates reachability vs filtering  

### AI Used For
- Breaking down protocol mechanics step-by-step  
- Explaining open vs closed vs filtered behavior  
- Clarifying what packet signals truly indicate  

### Impact on NetTower
- Improved interpretation of probe results  
- Reduced incorrect assumptions about reachability  

---

## Learning with AI – L2, L3, L4 Behavior, Constraints & Design Integration

### Objective
Understand what Layers 2–4 expose — and what they do not.

### Studied
- Effects of NAT, firewalls, segmentation  
- Timeouts vs rejects  
- Visibility limits in constrained networks  

### AI Used For
- Exploring misleading signals  
- Stress-testing inference assumptions  
- Validating cautious reasoning  

### Impact on NetTower
- Clearer distinction between confirmed vs inferred conclusions  
- More accurate uncertainty representation in visualization design  
- Stronger architectural decisions grounded in protocol behavior  
- AI supports technical learning — not product features  

---

## Risks Identified

- Incomplete or misleading network data  
- Overconfidence in inferred relationships  
- Segmented or filtered environments  
- Time constraints  

### Mitigation
- Explicit uncertainty modeling  
- Incremental architectural validation

## Sprint 2 Plan

### Sprint 2 Focus
Frontend, Visualization, Documentation, and Testing

#### Objectives
- Build topology interface  
- Integrate backend API  
- Implement interactive navigation  
- Add heat mapping & visual differentiation  

**Goal:** Functional prototype (Backend + Visualization)

### Sprint 2 Schedule
- S2W1 (Week 10 – 3/16): Building Front End  
- S2W2 (Week 11 – 3/23): Refinement of front end and visual enhancement  
- S2W3 (Week 12 – 3/30): Frontend–Backend Integration & Topology Rendering  
- S2W4 (Week 13 – 4/6): Performance Optimization & System Refinement + User Testing  
- S2W5 (Week 14 – 4/13): Documentation and publication prep  
- S2W6 (Week 15 – 4/20): Final testing, demo, and submission  

---

## Closing Summary

### Sprint 1 Outcome
- Backend discovery pipeline operational  
- Host and relationship modeling functional  
- Architecture stabilized  
- Technical assumptions validated through AI-supported learning  

**Next:** NetTower is ready for visualization development in Sprint 2.
